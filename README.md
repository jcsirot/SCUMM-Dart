SCUMMDart
=========

SCUMMDart is an implementation of the [SCUMM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCUMM) Engine writen in Dart aiming to run in a web browser. This development version focuses on SCUMM engine v5 and especially on "The Secret of Monkey Island" CD version.

Install
-------

The game ROM is not provided for obvious copyright issues. However it is quite simple to find it on abandonware websites. The development is done with a French CD version of "The Secret of Monkey Island".

To install the game, copy both files `monkey1.000` and `monkey1.001` in the `web/game/monkey` directory.

Known issues
------------

A lot... The engine is still in a very early development stage.
